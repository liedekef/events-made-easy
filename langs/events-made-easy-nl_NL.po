"While the setting above allows you to add extra html tags and attributes, "
"WordPress is even more strict concerning attributes allowed in the style "
"tag. You can here add a list of extra style attributes you want to allow in "
"EME settings that allow html (in addition to the defaults, nothing gets "
"removed). The list should be one attribute per line. As an example, to allow "
"the visibility attribute for the style tag, you would add: \"visbility\" "
msgstr ""
"Hoewel je met de bovenstaande instelling extra html-tags en attributen kunt "
"toevoegen, is WordPress nog strikter wat betreft attributen die zijn "
"toegestaan in de style-tag. U kunt hier een lijst met extra style-attributen "
"toevoegen die u wilt toestaan in EME-instellingen die html toestaan (naast "
"de standaardinstellingen, er wordt niets verwijderd). De lijst moet één "
"kenmerk per regel zijn. Als u bijvoorbeeld het zichtbaarheidsattribuut wilt "
"toestaan, voegt u toe: \"visbility\" "
