Manage and display events, memberships, recurring events, locations and maps, volunteers, widgets, RSVP, ICAL and RSS feeds, payment gateways support. SEO compatible.
             
== Description ==

Events Made Easy is a full-featured event and membership management solution for Wordpress and ClassicPress. Events Made Easy supports public, private, draft and recurring events, membership and locations management, RSVP (+ optional approval), several payment gateways (Paypal, 2Checkout, FirstData, Mollie and others) and OpenStreetMap integration. With Events Made Easy you can plan and publish your event, let people book spaces for your weekly meetings or manage volunteers and memberships. You can add events list, calendars and description to your blog using multiple sidebar widgets or shortcodes; if you are a web designer you can simply employ the placeholders provided by Events Made Easy. 

Main features:
* Public, private, draft and recurring events with custom and dynamic fields in the RSVP form
* Allow people to create events from the frontend using a specific shortcode
* Membership management with custom and dynamic fields
* Volunteer management for events (using event tasks)
* Attendance reporting for events and memberships if the rsvp or member qrcode is scanned by someone with enough rights
* Page and post content protection through memberships or via shortcodes
* Drip content via memberships
* People and groups with custom fields per person
* PDF creation for membership, bookings and people info
* Membership card or booking ticket can be sent as PDF via mail automatically, with optional QR code to scan for attendance/payment info
* RSS and ICAL feeds
* Calendar management, with holidays integration
* Several widgets for event listings and calendar
* Location management, with optional OpenStreetMap integration
* RSVP bookings with custom fields and dynamic fields, payment tracking, optional approval, discounts
* Protection of forms with internal captcha, Google reCaptcha or hCaptcha
* Templating for emails, event lists, single events, feeds, RSVP forms, ... with specific placeholders for each
* Lots of shortcodes and options
* Payment gateways: Paypal, FirstData, 2CheckOut, Mollie, Payconiq, Worldpay, Stripe, Braintree, Instamojo, Mercado Pago, Fondy, SumUp, Opayo
* Send emails to registered people, automatically send reminders for payments
* Automatically send reminders for memberships that are about to expire or have expired
* Mail queueing and newsletter functionality
* Mailings can be planned in the future, cancelled ... and can include extra attacments
* Multi-site compatible
* Several GDPR assistance features (request, view and edit personal info via link; delete old records for mailings, attendances, bookings)
* Fully localisable and already fully localised in German, Swedish, French and Dutch. Also fully compatible with polylang and qtranslate-xt (https://github.com/qtranslate/qtranslate-xt/): most of the settings allow for language tags so you can show your events in different languages to different people. The booking emails also take the choosen language into account. For other multi-lingual plugins, EME provides its own in-text language tags and takes the current chosen language into account.

  Function def:

     ==> $event_ids needs to be a CSV list of event ids
     ==> $group_ids needs to be a CSV list of group ids
     ==> $replytoemail and $replytoname are optional (then the from-info is taken)
* Unsent mail for a pending booking is removed if the payment arrives in time, to avoid the booker to receive 2 emails at the same time

* The configured payment gateways were not showing as expected
* Make "Show all bookings" in people overview work again as expected
* Added a REST API call, in case you don't trust WP cron to process the queue. As an example, you can call:
  curl --insecure --user "username:password" https://localhost/wordpress/wp-json/events-made-easy/v1/processqueue/60
  ==> don't user --insecure for public sites, and change "https://localhost/wordpress" by your wordpress url
  ==> change the "username" by your user and the "password" by an application password generated in your WP user settings
  ==> "60" means the script can run at most for 55 seconds (=60-5, 5 being a safety measure). Never set this higher than your cron recurrence of course
  ==> set the timing option for queue processing to "not scheduled" in EME, so the two don't interfere :-) But in fact: it doesn't really matter: EME is resilient enough to cope with both at the same time (but better be safe than sorry).

= 2.5.20 (2024/11/24) =
* Some HTML fixes

  #_TASKSIGNUPCHECKBOX <label for="#_TASKHTMLID">#_TASKNAME (#_TASKBEGIN - #_TASKEND) (#_FREETASKSPACES/#_TASKSPACES)</label> <br />

* CLI tool can allow mail from everywhere: allowed_senders=ALL

    eme_rsvp_email_from_pending_to_waitinglist_subject
    eme_rsvp_email_from_pending_to_waitinglist_body
    eme_rsvp_email_from_waitinglist_to_pending_subject

* New feature: pay for event submissions
* Event submissions can now send email to the person submitting (if logged in) and a defined contact person
* It's no longer needed to use #_CFCAPTCHA, #_HCAPTCHA, #RECAPTCHA. Just #_CAPTCHA is sufficient, since only one captcha is allowed and EME knows which one to use. If more than one captcha is configured, certain forms will use the first configured one.
* Action eme_ipn_fs_event_action added, executed after the submitted event is paid for (1 param: $event)
* Action eme_fs_submit_event_action added, executed after the event is submitted into EME (1 param: $event)

= 2.5.7 (2024/08/13) =
* The filterform placeholders #_FILTERWEEKS, #_FILTERMONTHS, #_FILTERYEARS now take 2 extra optional placeholders that indicate the number of week/months/years in the past and the future you want the scope to be. Example:
#_FILTERYEARS{5}{3} to create a year scope from 5 years in the past till 2 years in the future
#_FILTERYEARS{5} to create a year scope from 5 years in the past till the default scope count (taken from the eme_filterform shortcode) in the future
#_FILTERYEARS to create a year scope from now till the default scope count (taken from the eme_filterform shortcode) in the future
* The new FS form did not correctly noted down event start/end times

= 2.5.6 (2024/08/10) =
* Fix guest frontend event submit
* Fix redirection to event: if the submitted event is not public and a guest submitted it, we show the success message and don't redirect

= 2.5.5 (2024/08/07) =
* Frontend submit now supports generic EME placeholders and interprets shortcodes too
* New parameter for frontend submit: startdatetime=now. If used, the start date and time are by default set to
  the current date/time (as the old plugin did)
  Example: [eme_add_event_form startdatetime=now]
* Add a status to memberships, so you can put memberships as inactive

= 2.5.4 (2024/07/30) =
* syntax error fix

= 2.5.3 (2024/07/30) =
* Fix a typo causing custom field not to be rendered in the frontend add event form
* Make frontend submit also work when wysiwyg not activated
* Treat #_FIELD as #_PROP if a property with that name exists and no basic event setting (this in fact renders #_PROP a bit redundant, but since you need to look in the code to know all properties I'm going to leave it as is)

= 2.5.2 (2024/07/28) =
* Remove duplicate code from frontend submit
* Make sure the location id gets passed from frontend submit form (if selecting existing location), and latitude and longitude get added automatically

= 2.5.1 (2024/07/26) =
* Localising done earlier for the newly added javascript for frontend submit, so it works in all circumstances now (or it should)

= 2.5.0 (2024/07/26) =
* Integrated the frontend submit form, using [eme_add_event_form] shortcode and templating support
